"This would definitely cut the response time and probably prevent some criminal acts"
"If the system is accurate then it will surely improve authority response time. However, The Police Department all over South Africa are known to take their time when it comes to criminal  matters. The system will surely work, if the authority can put a little bit of work into what they do."

"I agree with the statement"
"Private security companies in suburbian areas have a very high response time and are usually in the area, if automatic alert - it will quicken time for security to be there"

"it could improve response time but here in SA it depends on where you live "
"People can be held accountable for not responding in time "
"Probably, provided that the surveilance includes short taped video, because I think  most of our police service servants belives in responding to things they see or what they think is true. Hence faith in the Justice system as a whole is zero, as they keep on making excuses when its due that they execute their duties.
